## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Table
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The project was a great learning opportunity. Key takeawyas:
- I learned how to syle list markers. 
- I learned that styling css table can be tricky. Margin does not work on `<tr>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>`
- I learned to pay attention to the line height.

### Continued development

In my next project I would like to pay more attention to the CSS structure. Make it modular?
